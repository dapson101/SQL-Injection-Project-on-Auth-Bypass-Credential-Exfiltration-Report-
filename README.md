SQL Injection Project on Auth Bypass & Credential 
Exfiltration
 Ethics & Scope: This project documents testing performed only against an intentionally 
vulnerable training instance provided for ethical practice. Do not use these techniques on 
systems you do not own or lack explicit written permission to test.
 Summary
 ● Target: Intentionally vulnerable login endpoint (training instance).
 ● Goal: Demonstrate SQL injection leading to authentication bypass and exfiltration of 
stored credentials.
 ● Methods:
 1. Manual exploitation via crafted payloads and wordlists.
 2. Automated exploitation using sqlmap.
 ● Tooling: Burp Suite (Proxy/Repeater/Intruder), sqlmap, Kali Linux payload wordlists 
(e.g., SQL.txt), browser.
 ● Outcome: Verified SQLi at login, bypassed auth, enumerated DB structure, and dumped 
user credential records (sanitized in report).
 Skills Demonstrated
 ● Web app recon & traffic interception (Burp Proxy)
 ● Input tampering & payload testing (error-based, boolean-based, union-based)
 ● Automating detection/exploitation with sqlmap
 High-Level Workflow
 1. Proxy setup → route browser through Burp; capture baseline login request.
 2. Manual SQLi testing → inject payloads in username/password; evaluate responses.
 3. Automated verification → run sqlmap against the same request to confirm and 
enumerate.
 4. Evidence → save key HTTP requests/responses and sanitized DB dumps.
 5. Reporting
